# Android App  > NeverForget

A reminder app which will never let you forget an event you need to be at.

Our idea is to create a scheduler app or a reminder app which can take notes and set a reminder as per user requirements and set an alert/Notification at the particular time set by the user.

Our application tries to help forgetful people and remind them of any events they donâ€™t want to forget. Users can add multiple events to our scheduler and can sync it with their account to store on cloud.

## APP Features
-	This app will use a listener to match set alerts by user and will notify user of the set activity
-	Our app will feature use of Date/Time pickers, Notification Channel, etc. and will also try to implement User Accounts and syncing
-	The app will allow multiple events to be added to notify the user about
-	Alerts can also happen at sometime
-	Things can repeat 
-	It can publish reminders to interested subscribers
