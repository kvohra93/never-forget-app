 ## Description
Our idea is to create a scheduler app or a reminder app which can take notes and set a reminder as per user requirements and set an alert/Notification at the particular time set by the user.

Our application tries to help forgetful people and remind them of any events they don’t want to forget. Users can add multiple events to our scheduler and can sync it with their account to store on cloud.

## APP Features
-	This app will use a listener to match set alerts by user and will notify user of the set activity
-	Our app will feature use of Date/Time pickers, Notification Channel, etc. and will also try to implement User Accounts and syncing
-	The app will allow multiple events to be added to notify the user about
-	Alerts can also happen at sometime
-	Things can repeat 
-	It can publish reminders to interested subscribers

## Applications
The application consists of 4 activities as below:-
1.	<b> Home </b> - Here, the user can view, access and modify events added earlier, modify application settings and also view a motivational quote. 
2.	<b>Create Reminder</b> - The user creates a new reminder of their choice by setting, day, date and time and selecting all other settings for the event.
3.	<b>View Reminder</b> - This is the landing page after user selects an activity from the home recycler view list.
4.	<b>Settings </b> - Here, the user can access all the application related settings.

Users can add multiple events and can synchronize between other android devices to get notified on any of their devices. Users will also be allowed to share their events with other users using our Share feature.

## Risky Components
•	To handle displaying of event objects, we will implement a recycler view.

•	To handle different type of event objects, we will use fragments which will toggle active or inactive based on current selection.

## App End Goals

- Notifies user of due events at specified timings.

- implements User Accounts and syncing.

- Allows adding multiple events per user.

- Share events with interested shareholders.

- View/Modify previously set events and notifications.

- Set repeating notifications (daily, weekly, yearly, etc.)

- Display motivation quotes on home screen.
